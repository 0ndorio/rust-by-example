Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure. For 
example, failing to read a file and then continuing to use that *bad* input 
would clearly be problematic. Error handling allows us to notice and handle 
those errors in an explicit fashion, saving the rest of the program from 
potential issues.

For additional information on error handling, see the section on error handling in the [official book][book].
