Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure. For 
example, failing to read a file and then continuing to use that *bad* input 
would clearly be problematic. Noticing and managing those errors in an 
explicit fashion saves the rest of the program from potential issues.

For additional information on error handling, see the section on error 
handling in the [official book][book].
