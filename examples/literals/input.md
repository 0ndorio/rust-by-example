Integers `1`, floats `1.2`, characters `'a'`, strings `"abc"`, booleans `true`
and the unit type `()` can be expressed using literals.

Integers can, alternatively, be expressed using hexadecimal, octal or binary
notation using either of these prefixes: `0x`, `0o` or `0b`.

Underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability, e.g.
`1_000` is the same as `1000`, and `0.000_001` is the same as `0.000001`.

The operators available and their precedence are similar to other
[C-like languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_precedence#Programming_languages).
