The `println!` macro not only prints to the console, but also is capable of
formatting text and stringifying values. Plus, the formatting correctness will
be checked at compile time.

{print.rs}

{print.out}

For more information about formatting, take a look at
[std::fmt](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/fmt/index.html).
