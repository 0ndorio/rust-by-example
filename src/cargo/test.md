# Testing

As we know testing is integral to any piece of software! Rust has first-class
support for unit and integration testing ([see that chapter for
more](https://rustbyexample.com/meta/test.html)). `cargo` naturally provides an
easy way to run all of your tests!

```sh
cargo test
```

or to run a specific test

```sh
cargo test test_foo
```

You should see output like this:

```
TODO TODO TODO (this is not what you will actually see)
```
