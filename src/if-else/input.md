Branching with if-else is similar to C. Unlike C, the boolean condition doesn't
need to be surrounded by parentheses. Each condition is followed by a block.

{if-else.rs}

{if-else.out}

If-else conditionals are expressions too. Because of Rust type safety, all the
branches must return the same type.

{if-else-expr.rs}

{if-else-expr.out}
