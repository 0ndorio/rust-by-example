# Testing

Rust is a programming language that cares a lot about correctness and it
includes support for writing software tests within the language itself.

Testing comes in three "tastes":

* [Unit][unit] testing.
* Doc testing.
* Integration testing.

Also Rust has support for spectifying additional dependencies for tests:
* Dev-dependencies.
